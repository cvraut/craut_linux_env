This is a collection of utils, files, scripts, & configs I thought were useful
to get setup on a new linux env

contents:
.vimrc
.tmux.conf

Current distros supported:
Centos 7

Todo:
1 cmd setup
 - I should be able to clone this & get started on the appropriate distro
 - creates symlinks to sync this repo and current env
