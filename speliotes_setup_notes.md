 - get right version of tmux running so my configs and tmux-resurrect would work
   - `tmux -V` get version
   - we want version >= 1.9
   - [Follow these instructions to install tmux without root](https://www.looklinux.com/how-to-install-tmux-from-source-non-root-user/)

## Step 2:
 - get the vim and tmux confs 
 - copy the .tmux file over from my repo
 - add +x ability to the whole directory (recursively)
 - verify that tmux-continuum works

## Step 3:
 - copy the vim configurations in `.vimrc` and `.vim` folders

## Step 4:
 - update the git
